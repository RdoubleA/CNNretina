# Diagnosing Retinal Pathology using Deep Learning

We use existing deep learning architectures - VGGNet and Inception - to diagnose various retinal diseases using a large dataset of optical coherence tomography images.

The main results can be seen in the Final Poster and Final Report files. The Jupyter notebooks that performed the computation/analyses are located in the notebook folder.
